# 🏅 Olympic Athletes Data Cleaning with Pandas

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a real-world **Olympic Athletes dataset** using **Python Pandas**.  
The goal is to transform raw, imperfect data into a structured and analysis-ready format by applying standard data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.

The project emphasizes clarity, readability, and best practices commonly used in real data analysis workflows.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design and implement a data cleaning pipeline that:
- Handles missing values effectively
- Standardizes column names
- Converts date fields into proper datetime format
- Engineers meaningful features from existing data
- Produces a clean dataset ready for analysis and visualization

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Skills Used
- Pandas DataFrame operations  
- Handling missing values (`fillna`)  
- Column name standardization  
- Datetime conversion  
- Feature engineering (age calculation)  
- Sorting, filtering, and aggregation  
- Basic data validation  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
1. Created a working copy of the raw dataset  
2. Standardized column names for consistency  
3. Filled missing height and weight values using column means  
4. Converted birth and death dates to datetime format  
5. Calculated athlete age (current age or age at death)  
6. Validated cleaned data and saved the final dataset  

---

## 📊 Visual Analysis
- Distribution of athlete ages  
- Height vs Weight relationship  
- Top countries by athlete count  

These visuals help validate data quality and extract simple insights from the cleaned dataset.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
